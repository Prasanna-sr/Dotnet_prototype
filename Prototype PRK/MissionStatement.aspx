                        California State University - Production and Operations Management (CSU-POM), Inc.
                        is to disseminate POM research and practices to POM educators and practitioners
                        by facilitating the exchange of ideas leading to the theoretical and applied POM
                        research through CSU-POM conferences and California Journal of Operations Management
                        (CJOM). CSU-POM conferences are held annually to discuss the current issues and
                        directions in POM curricula and research so that POM faculty will continue to strive
                        for research and teaching excellence, and classroom application of real-world POM
                        practices. CJOM (ISSN: 1542-4006) is a refereed journal established in 2003 and
                        listed in the Cabell's Directory of Refereed Publications. The main purpose of CJOM
                        is to provide a place for sharing original applied and theoretical research in operations
                        and supply chain management. The Journal has also evolved as an innovative publication
                        for scholars and practitioners to exchange their ideas and results in research,
                        teaching, and practice of operations and supply chain management.
